## Learning Objectives
### General
- Why JavaScript programming is amazing
- How to manipulate JSON data
- How to use request and fetch API
- How to read and write a file using fs module

## Requirements
## General
- Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
- All your files will be interpreted on `Ubuntu 20.04 LTS` using `node` (`version 14.x`)
- All your files should end with a new line
- The first line of all your files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/node`
- A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
- Your code should be `semistandard` compliant. [Rules of Standard](https://standardjs.com/rules.html) + [semicolons on top](https://github.com/standard/semistandard). Also as reference: [AirBnB style](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript)
- All your files must be executable
- The length of your files will be tested using `wc`
- You are not allowed to use `var`

## More Info
### Install Node 14
```Bash
$ curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_14.x | sudo -E bash -
$ sudo apt-get install -y nodejs
```

### Install semi-standard
[Documentation](https://github.com/standard/semistandard)
```Bash
$ sudo npm install semistandard --global
```

### Install `request` module and use it
[Documentation](https://github.com/request/request)
```Bash
$ sudo npm install request --global
$ export NODE_PATH=/usr/lib/node_modules
```

__Notes:__ Request module has been deprecated since February 2020 - the team is considering alternative to replace this module - however, itâ€™s a really simple and powerful module for practicing web-scraping in JavaScript (and still used a lot in the industry).
