# 0x03. Python - Data Structures: Lists, Tuples

# Requirements

# Python Scripts
* Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
* All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5)
* All your files should end with a new line
* The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/python3
* A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
* Your code should use the pycodestyle (version 2.8.*)
* All your files must be executable
* The length of your files will be tested using wc

# C
* Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
* All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5)
* All your files should end with a new line
* Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
* You are not allowed to use global variables
* No more than 5 functions per file
* In the following examples, the main.c files are shown as examples. You can use them to test your functions, but you don’t have to push them to your repo (if you do we won’t take them into account). We will use our own main.c files at compilation. Our main.c files might be different from the one shown in the examples
* The prototypes of all your functions should be included in your header file called lists.h
* Don’t forget to push your header file
* All your header files should be include guarded

# Tasks
0 - Task 0 - Write a function that prints all integers of a list.
1 - Task 1 - Write a function that retrieves an element from a list like in C.
2 - Task 2 - Write a function that replaces an element of a list at a specific position (like in C).
3 - Task 3 - Write a function that prints all integers of a list, in reverse order.
4 - Task 4 - Write a function that replaces an element in a list at a specific position without modifying the original list (like in C).
5 - Task 5 - Write a function that removes all characters c and C from a string.
6 - Task 6 - Write a function that prints a matrix of integers.
7 - Task 7 - Write a function that adds 2 tuples.
8 - Task 8 - Write a function that returns a tuple with the length of a string and its first character.
9 - Task 9 - Write a function that finds the biggest integer of a list.
10 - Task 10 - Write a function that finds all multiples of 2 in a list.
11 - Task 11 - Write a function that deletes the item at a specific position in a list.
12 - Task 12 - Complete the source code in order to switch value of a and b
13 - Task 13 - Write a function in C that checks if a singly linked list is a palindrome.
14 - Task 14 - Create a C function that prints some basic info about Python lists.
